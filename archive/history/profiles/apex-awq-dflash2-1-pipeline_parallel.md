# apex-awq-dflash2-1-pipeline_parallel

**Historical record. Definition; no matched test receipt.**

Model family: Apex Flash 1 (GLM 5.3 Flash post-train).

The campaign inventory recorded status `unmeasured`. The evidence sections retain any later results separately.

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [apex-abliterated-awq-dflash2-pp3-balanced](../../../recipes/apex-abliterated-awq-dflash2-pp3-balanced/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

| Configuration | Recorded artifact / source | Configured card counts | Context tokens | GPU pool tokens | Slots | Draft mode / tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cfg-4e3c76e24ab26d6b859c | [svbmrgd/apex-flash-1-abliterated-AWQ@7ea31e3d22](https://huggingface.co/svbmrgd/apex-flash-1-abliterated-AWQ/tree/7ea31e3d22c6622c999d3de74d1569efce815943) | 3 | 262,144 | Not recorded | 4 | dflash2 / 1 |

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

# mimo-flash-ordinary-500k-context

**Historical record. Additional test results; no matched decode wave.**

Model family: MiMo V2.6 Flash.

Recorded archive reason: Ordinary comparison control; MTP and DFlash retained.

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [mimo-flash-mtp1-tp3](../../../recipes/mimo-flash-mtp1-tp3/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

## Additional Test Results

| Result / Source | Profile | Evidence type | Reported outcome | Retained values | Configuration binding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [result-fe89b69cc15d2e243fa5](../observations.json)<br>source-99e893824202882e371a4815.json<br>`/original_job/tabby` | [mimo-flash-ordinary-500k-context](mimo-flash-ordinary-500k-context.md) | test outcome | Outcome unspecified | cache_tokens=1,048,576 tokens | Recorded configuration/job |

These are saved result records, including failures and bounded checks. Copies, individual requests, report summaries and regrading can overlap; their counts are not independent test repetitions. Open each result for exact values, units, configuration binding and source receipts.

There are 1 retained lifecycle records. Their states, exit codes and configuration IDs remain in [catalog.json](../catalog.json); they do not supply missing benchmark results.

# ad024-flash-mtp2-native-final-008

**Historical record. Bounded checks only.**

Model family: Qwen 3.8 Flash Next.

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [qwen-flash-next-mtp2-layer-split](../../../recipes/qwen-flash-next-mtp2-layer-split/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

| Configuration | Recorded artifact / source | Configured card counts | Context tokens | GPU pool tokens | Slots | Draft mode / tokens |

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

## Bounded Checks

| Check | Reported outcome | Retained counts / flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| check-2454969e01d955bb4ba5 | Pass | {"actual_long_request_prompt_tokens":2055,"passed":true,"configured_slots":6,"context_tokens":4096} |

These checks retain their reported scope. A context/allocation/retrieval check is not a general quality score or a speed qualification at that context. Exact flags and provenance are in [checks.json](../checks.json).

## Additional Test Results

| Result / Source | Profile | Evidence type | Reported outcome | Retained values | Configuration binding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [result-3b4b5892a89af59a43ef](../observations.json)<br>source-7978aacbd68785ecf259604a.json<br>`/` | [ad024-flash-mtp2-native-final-008](ad024-flash-mtp2-native-final-008.md) | context allocation | Pass | actual_long_request_prompt_tokens=2,055 tokens; configured_slots=6 requests; context_tokens=4,096 tokens; 6 mixed-length request records | Recorded configuration/job |
| [result-a07fb424b3f7095ff932](../observations.json)<br>source-cecfe5ec5f3c1ba1e828a420.json<br>`/tabby` | [ad024-flash-mtp2-native-final-008](ad024-flash-mtp2-native-final-008.md) | test outcome | Outcome unspecified | cache_tokens=1,356,032 tokens | Recorded configuration/job |

These are saved result records, including failures and bounded checks. Copies, individual requests, report summaries and regrading can overlap; their counts are not independent test repetitions. Open each result for exact values, units, configuration binding and source receipts.

There are 1 retained lifecycle records. Their states, exit codes and configuration IDs remain in [catalog.json](../catalog.json); they do not supply missing benchmark results.

# flash_next-mtp2-original-layer_split-ad024-ctx524288-qualification

**Historical record. Bounded checks only.**

Model family: Qwen 3.8 Flash Next.

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [qwen-flash-next-mtp2-layer-split](../../../recipes/qwen-flash-next-mtp2-layer-split/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

| Configuration | Recorded artifact / source | Configured card counts | Context tokens | GPU pool tokens | Slots | Draft mode / tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cfg-658e32198a7ed4a0096c | [turboderp/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-exl3@d2e238feca](https://huggingface.co/turboderp/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-exl3/tree/d2e238feca4c1c4d966943117356d8a42c2f4dcb) (derived view) | 2 | 524,288 | 1,356,032 | 6 | mtp / 2 |

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

## Bounded Checks

| Check | Reported outcome | Retained counts / flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| check-39ef87917576a85c3e0f | Pass | {"history_restoration_tested":false,"context_tokens":524288,"resident_pool_tokens":1356032,"passed":true,"retention_pressure_tested":false,"actual_long_request_prompt_tokens":522294,"useful_long_context_retrieval":true,"configured_slots":6} |

These checks retain their reported scope. A context/allocation/retrieval check is not a general quality score or a speed qualification at that context. Exact flags and provenance are in [checks.json](../checks.json).

These are saved result records, including failures and bounded checks. Copies, individual requests, report summaries and regrading can overlap; their counts are not independent test repetitions. Open each result for exact values, units, configuration binding and source receipts.

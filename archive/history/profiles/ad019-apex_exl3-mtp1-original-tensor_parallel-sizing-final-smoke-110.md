# ad019-apex_exl3-mtp1-original-tensor_parallel-sizing-final-smoke-110

**Historical record. Job history; no matched benchmark.**

Model family: Apex Flash 1 (GLM 5.3 Flash post-train).

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [apex-abliterated-exl3-mtp1-tp3](../../../recipes/apex-abliterated-exl3-mtp1-tp3/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

There are 1 retained lifecycle records. Their states, exit codes and configuration IDs remain in [catalog.json](../catalog.json); they do not supply missing benchmark results.

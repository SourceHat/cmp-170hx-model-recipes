# ab-orca-mtp3-original-layer_split-ctx262144-044

**Historical record. Additional test results; no matched decode wave.**

Model family: Orca (Qwen 3.8 27B abliterated).

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [qwen27-orca-mtp3-native](../../../recipes/qwen27-orca-mtp3-native/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

## Additional Test Results

| Result / Source | Profile | Evidence type | Reported outcome | Retained values | Configuration binding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [result-2444cdb1593922e575e6](../observations.json)<br>source-a9e622d351a86c8b776605d4.json<br>`/managed_phase_timings/44` | [ab-orca-mtp3-original-layer_split-ctx262144-044](ab-orca-mtp3-original-layer_split-ctx262144-044.md) | test outcome | Outcome unspecified | wall_seconds=560.55 s | Recorded configuration/job |

These are saved result records, including failures and bounded checks. Copies, individual requests, report summaries and regrading can overlap; their counts are not independent test repetitions. Open each result for exact values, units, configuration binding and source receipts.

There are 1 retained lifecycle records. Their states, exit codes and configuration IDs remain in [catalog.json](../catalog.json); they do not supply missing benchmark results.

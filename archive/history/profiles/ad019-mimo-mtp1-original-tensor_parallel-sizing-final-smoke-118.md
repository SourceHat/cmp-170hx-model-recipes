# ad019-mimo-mtp1-original-tensor_parallel-sizing-final-smoke-118

**Historical record. Bounded checks only.**

Model family: MiMo V2.6 Flash.

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [mimo-flash-mtp1-tp3](../../../recipes/mimo-flash-mtp1-tp3/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

## Bounded Checks

| Check | Reported outcome | Retained counts / flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| check-88931bc999cc989d6aa8 | Pass | {"passed":true,"configured_slots":4,"context_tokens":524288} |
| check-9555fcbaa2dd9b265d35 | Pass | {"passed":true,"configured_slots":4,"context_tokens":524288} |

These checks retain their reported scope. A context/allocation/retrieval check is not a general quality score or a speed qualification at that context. Exact flags and provenance are in [checks.json](../checks.json).

These are saved result records, including failures and bounded checks. Copies, individual requests, report summaries and regrading can overlap; their counts are not independent test repetitions. Open each result for exact values, units, configuration binding and source receipts.

There are 1 retained lifecycle records. Their states, exit codes and configuration IDs remain in [catalog.json](../catalog.json); they do not supply missing benchmark results.

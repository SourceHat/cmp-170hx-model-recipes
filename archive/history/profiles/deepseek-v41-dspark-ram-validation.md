# deepseek-v41-dspark-ram-validation

**Historical record. Bounded checks only.**

Model family: DeepSeek.

Historical configurations are provided for comparison. The [recommended recipes](../../../README.md) include supported launch scripts.

Current recipes using the same recorded checkpoint repository: [deepseek-v41-flash-dspark5-tp3](../../../recipes/deepseek-v41-flash-dspark5-tp3/README.md). Context, cache and runtime versions can differ.

## Saved Configuration Versions

Each configuration ID identifies a distinct original settings record. Deployment fields are omitted; versions can have identical published settings after that omission. Upstream runtime commits remain unspecified where the source retained only an integration label.

| Configuration | Recorded artifact / source | Configured card counts | Context tokens | GPU pool tokens | Slots | Draft mode / tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cfg-2aec4951a1a3215a301f | [sfxnz/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3@982b70452f](https://huggingface.co/sfxnz/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3/tree/982b70452f399814f56b46272fd30394ae10d58c) | 3 | 32,768 | Not recorded | 4 | dspark / 5 |

Card counts are saved configuration choices, not a claim that every allowed placement was measured. A derived view can differ from its pinned download source.

## Retained Measurements

No detailed benchmark receipt is matched to this record. A saved definition or a successful job exit alone is not a performance measurement.

A dash in shared decode means no qualified synchronized interval is available. Whole-wave throughput includes prefill and queueing. A valid decode interval can survive inside an overall failed or partial check; the source-report outcome is preserved. No rows are averaged.

## Bounded Checks

| Check | Reported outcome | Retained counts / flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| check-06f90ea06234fc8eeaec | Pass | {"passed":true,"ram_restoration_qualified":true} |

These checks retain their reported scope. A context/allocation/retrieval check is not a general quality score or a speed qualification at that context. Exact flags and provenance are in [checks.json](../checks.json).

## Additional Test Results

| Result / Source | Profile | Evidence type | Reported outcome | Retained values | Configuration binding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [result-86831c133f60e1cdb261](../observations.json)<br>source-20fa4440e41bc4d25b0aac60.json<br>`/` | [deepseek-v41-dspark-ram-validation](deepseek-v41-dspark-ram-validation.md) | test outcome | Pass | passed=true; ram_restoration_qualified=true | Recorded configuration/job |

These are saved result records, including failures and bounded checks. Copies, individual requests, report summaries and regrading can overlap; their counts are not independent test repetitions. Open each result for exact values, units, configuration binding and source receipts.

There are 1 retained lifecycle records. Their states, exit codes and configuration IDs remain in [catalog.json](../catalog.json); they do not supply missing benchmark results.
